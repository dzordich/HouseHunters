# House Hunters - Java Edition 

This is a remake of a project I made at Momentum Learning in Java. [The original](https://github.com/momentum-cohort-2019-05/w2d1-house-hunting-dzordich) is written in python.

## Description

After graduating from Momentum, you start a new job with a good salary and now you want to save up to buy a house. You're going to need a down payment, though. In this lab, you are going to write a program to help you determine how long it will take to save enough money to make the down payment.

### Test Case 1

```
Enter your annual salary: 120000
Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: .10
Enter the cost of your dream home: 1000000
Number of months: 183
```

### Test Case 2

```
Enter your annual salary: 80000
Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: .15
Enter the cost of your dream home: 500000
Number of months: 105
```
